### 🧠 2. Validate & Structure the Following Folders in `/services/`

* Check each listed folder path above
* If missing:

  * Create the folder with `README.md`
  * Optionally include `module.json` or `info.txt` with metadata (e.g., type, linked SQL)
* Ensure all folders have linked dashboard cards on Developer Portal

---

### 🧩 3. Developer Portal Section Update

* Group all services (from Phase 1 & 2) under:

  * ✅ "Core EHB Modules"
  * 📦 "Automations & Tools"
  * 🌍 "Global Configs"
* Use filters or tags for:

  * \[Core], \[AI], \[UI], \[Automation], \[Business], \[Security]

---

### 🛠 4. Enable Click-to-Open Folder Access (Optional)

* Enable developers to click a service card and be navigated inside that folder in Replit (if supported)
* If not possible, link to `README.md` route or show quick info popup on hover

---

✅ Ready for **Phase 3**?

Say “**next**” to continue.
