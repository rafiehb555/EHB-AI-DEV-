### 📂 2. Developer Portal Sections

Group these into a **“DevOps & Automation”** tab inside the portal UI:

* 🔄 File Management
* 🧪 Testing & Deployment
* 💬 Logs & Health Monitoring
* ⚙️ Rule-based Configuration

Enable filter/sort by:

* Service Type (Tool, Module, Dev)
* Parent Folder
* AI/Manual Script

---

### 🧱 3. Validate Folder Existence & Structure in `/services/`

For each listed module above:

* Check if folder exists, create if missing
* Add `README.md`, `index.js`, or metadata file
* For AI modules, ensure `/config.json` or `/instructions.txt` is present inside folder

---

### 🔗 4. Connect to Developer Portal Dynamic Engine

* Auto-link each card to its folder
* If developer clicks, show folder preview or details popup
* Use icons and color codes for tool category

---

✅ All advanced tools and developer-side microservices are now integrated.

Say **next** for Phase 4, which will focus on **System Layer (SQL, Blockchain, Config)**.
