📁 Target Base Path:
All ZIPs must extract and deploy their files under:

swift
Copy
Edit
/services/SOT-Technologies/EHB-AI-Dev/
🧠 What Replit Agent Should Do for Each ZIP:
Detect ZIPs in /uploaded-zips/ folder

Unzip → Only extract relevant files inside /services/SOT-Technologies/EHB-AI-Dev/Phase-[x]/

✅ If extracted folder contains:

frontend/ → move to .../Phase-[x]/frontend

backend/ → move to .../Phase-[x]/backend

admin/ → move to .../Phase-[x]/admin

⚙️ Agent should log install success in /logs/free-agent.log

🧹 After extraction:

Delete ZIP file from /uploaded-zips/

Delete temp extracted copy (if any)

📌 Make sure each ZIP is self-contained (nothing should overwrite existing code)

🗂️ File Handling by Phase:
Phase	Destination Folder
1	/services/SOT-Technologies/EHB-AI-Dev/Phase-1-Free-Agent/
2	/services/SOT-Technologies/EHB-AI-Dev/Phase-2-Free-Agent/
...	...
10	/services/SOT-Technologies/EHB-AI-Dev/Phase-10-Free-Agent/
