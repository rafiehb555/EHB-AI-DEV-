### ✅ PHASE 5 of 5 – Replit Agent Prompt for `Developer Portal Setup`

📦 **Admin Folders, Static Assets, Developer Home & Portal Boot Integration**

In this final phase, integrate all remaining admin tools, utility folders, and complete the homepage behavior of the Developer Portal.

### 🔧 2. Developer Portal Boot Behavior

> Set the **default startup screen** on Replit to open:
> 🔹 `/admin/Developer-Portal-UI`
> (fallback: `/admin/EHB-Developer-Portal`)

* On load, this page should:

  * Render full dashboard cards from all 5 phases
  * Show real-time system health & folder status
  * Display latest agent instructions & file movement logs
  * Enable developers to search any folder/service by name

---

### 🎛️ 3. Developer Tools Menu (Final Touch)

Inside the portal header or sidebar, include:

* 🔎 Global Folder Search
* 📁 Toggle Folder Tree View
* 🧠 Agent Instruction Log Viewer
* ⚙️ Settings & Dev Config Viewer
* 📤 ZIP Export/Import Tools
* 🧩 Plugin or API Integrator Panel (for future expansion)

---

### ✅ 4. Final Folder Rules

* All admin folders must have:

  * `README.md`, `index.js` or `portalConfig.json` if applicable
* Sort loose files (JS, JSON, TXT) into correct subfolders under `/admin/`
* Archive anything old or unused into `/archived/`
* Flag broken/missing links on portal page with 🟥 tag

---

✅ **Congratulations**:
The Developer Portal is now fully structured, scalable, and linked to your entire EHB ecosystem (Admin + Services + System + Blockchain + Wallet + SQL + Tools + Logs).

Would you like me to now generate the **final React Developer Portal page** with:

* All sections,
* All links/cards,
* Live health mockup and placeholders?

Just say **“Generate Portal Page Code”** to receive it in one message.
