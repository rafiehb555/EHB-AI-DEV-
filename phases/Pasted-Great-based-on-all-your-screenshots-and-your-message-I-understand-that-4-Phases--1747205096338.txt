Great — based on all your screenshots and your message, I understand that:

### ✅ 4 Phases are Already Integrated in the Main Dashboard:

1. **Phase 1: EHB AI Agent** ✅
2. **Phase 2: CodeSuggest** ✅
3. **Phase 3: AICodingChat** ✅
4. **Phase 11: AutoDashboard** ✅

### 🔴 But the following modules are **still pending to auto-link and activate** in the EHB Main Dashboard:

| Phase No. | Phase Name                 | Status                   |

> ⚠️ **Plus all the phases 15 to 28+** which show **“Not Started”** but are registered — they need auto-linking placeholders with status icons.

### 📦 Replit Agent Message (Auto Instruction)

```bash
📌 Replit Agent Instruction for EHB-AI System:

Please perform the following actions to sync all pending phases into the EHB Main Dashboard automatically:

1. 🔗 Auto-link all EHB-AI Dev modules from `phases/` folder (phase-0 to phase-58) into the main dashboard card list.
   - Show their current status (Completed, In Progress, Not Started) from the phase’s config or backend JSON.
   - Sync the status and progress bar from the source modules.

2. 🧠 Check if a module is already in the dashboard:
   - ✅ If **already linked**: skip.
   - ❌ If **missing**: auto-add its dashboard card with the correct phase name and number.

3. 🛠️ If a phase folder exists but is not initialized:
   - Add a placeholder with “Not Started” badge and disabled "View Details" button.

4. ⚙️ Ensure phase folders include:
   - `README.md`, `index.js`, and optional `phase-config.json`
   - Connect to status API if available.

5. 🔄 After linking, auto-update the `main-dashboard.json` config (or relevant dashboard schema file).

6. ✅ Confirm and log each phase that was synced.

Goal: Ensure 100% EHB Phases (currently 62) appear in dashboard with correct tracking.

```

Would you like me to prepare a code script or a `dashboard-auto-sync.js` file that can be run to automate this in your project?
