# AI Module Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the AI capabilities within the EHB platform.

## AI Integration Points

The AI module integrates with several other components of the EHB platform:

1. **Dashboard Interface**: AI-powered insights and recommendations
2. **Document Management**: Intelligent document categorization and search
3. **User Experience**: Contextual help and onboarding assistance
4. **Analytics**: Predictive analysis and trend identification
5. **Feedback Loop**: AI response quality improvement system

## AI Models Used

The AI module leverages two primary AI services:

### OpenAI
- **Purpose**: Advanced natural language processing, content generation, and conversational AI
- **Integration**: Via the OpenAI API client
- **Models Used**: GPT-4 and related models
- **Configuration**: Set via environment variables and configuration files

### Anthropic
- **Purpose**: Context-aware explanations and ethical reasoning
- **Integration**: Via the Anthropic Claude API
- **Models Used**: Claude models
- **Configuration**: Set via environment variables and configuration files

## AI Features

### AI Explanations
- Contextual help for various parts of the application
- Role-specific explanations based on user type (buyer, seller, admin)
- Multi-format responses (standard, conversational, bullet points)

### AI Feedback System
- User ratings for AI responses
- Suggestion collection for AI improvement
- Analytics on AI performance
- Admin tools to review and act on feedback

### AI Knowledge Base
- Domain-specific knowledge retrieval
- Role-specific terminology and instructions
- Context detection from user messages

## Error Handling

The AI module includes robust error handling:

- Fallback explanations when AI services are unavailable
- Rate limiting protection
- Error reporting and monitoring
- Graceful degradation of AI features

## Database Integration

AI-related data is stored in Supabase with the following tables:

- `ai_feedback`: Stores user ratings and comments on AI responses
- `ai_suggestions`: Stores user suggestions for AI improvement

## Security Considerations

- API keys are stored securely in environment variables
- User data is anonymized before being sent to AI services
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Content filtering is applied to inputs and outputs

## Frontend Components

The AI module includes several frontend components:

- `AIExplainButton.js`: Trigger for contextual explanations
- `AIExplanationModal.js`: Modal for displaying AI explanations
- `AIFeedbackForm.js`: Form for collecting user feedback on AI responses
- `AISuggestionForm.js`: Form for collecting user suggestions for AI improvement

## Backend Services

The AI module includes several backend services:

- `aiExplainController.js`: Handles requests for AI explanations
- `aiFeedbackController.js`: Handles AI feedback and suggestions
- `aiKnowledgeBase.js`: Manages domain-specific knowledge
- `aiErrorHandler.js`: Provides AI-powered error analysis and recovery

## Integration Instructions

To integrate the AI module with other EHB components:

1. Import the appropriate AI components or controllers
2. Add AI explanation buttons to UI elements that need contextual help
3. Implement feedback collection for AI interactions
4. Use the AI knowledge base for domain-specific assistance
