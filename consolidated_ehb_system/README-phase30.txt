📘 Phase 30: Auto Complaint System + Franchise Escalation Workflow

✅ Components:

- Backend: Auto-routing based on franchise type (sub → master → corporate)
- Models: Complaint schema with timestamps, status, escalatedTo
- Admin: Dashboard to see unresolved escalated cases

🛠 Setup Instructions:
- Upload folders into Replit/VSCode structure
- Ensure MongoDB connected and JWT enabled
- Use mock franchise roles to test flow

📁 Folder Naming:
- frontend-phase30/
- backend-phase30/

Allow users to register complaints which auto-escalate if not resolved within time window. Admins view unresolved ones.
