Based on everything you’ve shared — including your folder structures, system layout, and development goals — here's the **Final Replit Agent Prompt** that introduces the EHB Technologies system to Replit **as a full company-wide ecosystem with structured folders, flow logic, and dynamic handling**.

## 🧠 FINAL FULL COMPANY INTRODUCTION PROMPT FOR REPLIT AGENT

(You can paste this in one shot or assign it as a master setup instruction.)

### 📢 **REPLIT AGENT INSTRUCTION: EHB Technologies Limited – Ecosystem Integration & Flow Setup**

> You are now managing the development environment for **EHB Technologies Limited**, a global AI + Blockchain-based service ecosystem. This project is structured across multiple folders representing services, admin panels, system configs, and department-level logic.

---

### 🏢 **Company Introduction**

**EHB Technologies Limited** is a multi-service platform offering:

* ✅ 700+ AI-verified services
* ✅ Global e-commerce
* ✅ Government-level SQL verification (Free → VIP)
* ✅ Blockchain validator system
* ✅ Franchise-based real-world deployment
* ✅ Multi-department models: PSS, EMO, EDR, etc.

EHB operates across 3 main folder roots:

```
📁 /admin
📁 /services
📁 /system
```

These must be respected as isolated + linked modules.

---

### 🧭 **STRUCTURE FLOW (ROOT FOLDERS)**

#### 📁 /admin → For all UI, dashboards, management panels

* `ehb-admin-panel/` → Full admin logic
* `Developer-Portal-UI/` → Main control center
* `EHB-HOME/` & `EHB-DASHBOARD/` → Core routing
* `ehb-wallet/`, `User-flow/`, `integration-script.js` → Wallet & flow engines

#### 📁 /services → For all modular services (Product + Features)

Includes:

* `EHB-GoSellr/`, `EHB-AI-Marketplace/`, `WMS-World-Medical-Service/`
* `AI-Agent-Execution-Script/`, `Auto-ZIP-Handler-Agent/`, `JPS-Job-Providing-Service/`
* `HPS-Education-Service/`, `OLS-Online-Law-Service/`, and more

> Each service is self-contained, with subfolders and routing logic. They are AI-searchable.

#### 📁 /system → Core backend, blockchain, SQL logic

Contains:

* SQL Verification Engines → `EHB-SQL-PSS`, `EHB-SQL-EDR`, `EHB-SQL-EMO`
* Blockchain Flow → `EHB-Blockchain/`, `structure-maintainer.js`
* Rules + UI Configs → `rules/`, `ui-config/`, `structure.json`

---

### 🧠 **FLOW LOGIC (AGENT TASK LIST)**

1. ✅ **Scan all folders** under `/admin`, `/services`, `/system`
2. ✅ Auto-create missing subfolders using templates:

   * Must contain `README.md` + `index.js` or `config.json`
3. ✅ If any file is in the wrong place:

   * Move it to the proper folder without deletion
4. ✅ Respect URL mappings exactly as provided
5. ✅ Enable dynamic card generation inside `Developer-Portal-UI` for:

   * All service folders
   * System modules
   * SQL engines
6. ✅ Run auto structure validation every session and display results in the Developer Portal dashboard

---

### 🖥️ **DEFAULT LOADING PAGE**

> When the app or project is opened, Replit must load:

```
/admin/Developer-Portal-UI/
```

This portal shows:

* Folder health
* Real-time file changes
* AI agent instructions
* Quick links to GoSellr, Wallet, Franchise, Blockchain, etc.
* Dashboard cards grouped by SQL Level and system role

---

### ⚙️ **KEY LOGIC FOR REPLIT TO FOLLOW**

| Task                                  | Action                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Loose file detected (e.g., `page.js`) | Move to related folder like `/admin/pages/`       |
| New service ZIP added                 | Auto-extract and map to `/services/ServiceName/`  |
| SQL file dropped in root              | Route to `/system/EHB-SQL/` and tag by department |
| Unknown folder added                  | Ask AI agent to classify and place it             |
| Missing link in Portal                | Flag red in UI, show "Fix Now" option             |

---

### 🔗 **EXAMPLE: How Replit should treat a new service**

> If `EHB-Speech-Translator.zip` is uploaded:

* Extract to `/services/EHB-Speech-Translator/`
* Generate Developer Portal card
* Add route `/services/EHB-Speech-Translator/README.md`
* Tag as `[AI][TRANSLATION]`

---

### ✅ CONCLUSION

This Replit environment represents a **live operating system** for EHB Technologies. Maintain it like a modular blockchain ecosystem:

* Do **not delete** files.
* Always respect `folder-role > sub-role > linked route`.
* Sync instructions with AI logs.
* Alert developer if conflict occurs between folder mapping.

Would you like me to now generate the **DeveloperPortal.jsx code** that matches this prompt, including:

* Full card grid
* System status viewer
* Dynamic folder + route linking
* Health check + missing flag UI?

Just say **"Generate Developer Portal Code"**.
