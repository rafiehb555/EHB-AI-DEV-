# Franchise System

This module handles the franchise management system for EHB. It manages sub/master/corporate franchises and contains the core logic for:

- Franchise levels and hierarchy management
- Complaints handling and escalation
- Earnings distribution and calculation
- Zone handling and territory management
- Escalation code and processes

## Structure

- `levels/` - Management of franchise levels and hierarchies
- `complaints/` - Complaint handling and resolution processes
- `earnings/` - Calculations and distribution of franchise earnings

## Integration

This is a system-level module, not a service. It provides core functionality that other parts of the system rely on.
