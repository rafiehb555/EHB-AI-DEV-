# EHB System Architecture

## Overview

The Enterprise Hybrid Blockchain (EHB) platform is a comprehensive business management system that leverages blockchain technology alongside traditional web services to provide a secure, scalable, and efficient platform for enterprise operations.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. User Interface Layer

- **EHB-HOME**: Central dashboard and entry point for all services
- **EHB-DASHBOARD**: Administrative and operational dashboard
- **EHB-Developer-Portal**: Development environment and documentation
- **ehb-admin-panel**: Administrative control panel

### 2. Service Layer

- **EHB-GoSellr**: E-commerce and sales platform
- **Auto-ZIP-Handler-Agent**: Automated file processing service
- **Home-Dashboard-Linker**: Integration service for UI components

### 3. System Layer

- **EHB-Blockchain**: Core blockchain infrastructure
- **EHB-Services-Departments-Flow**: Workflow and business process management
- **EHB-SQL**: Database management and data services

### 4. Integration Layer

- **API Gateway**: Unified API access point
- **Event Bus**: Asynchronous message passing system
- **Redirectors**: Traffic management services

## Communication Flow

```
User → UI Layer → Service Layer → System Layer → Database/Blockchain
```

## Data Flow

1. User requests enter through the UI layer
2. Requests are processed by appropriate services
3. Data modifications are validated through the system layer
4. Critical transactions are recorded on the blockchain
5. Results flow back through the service layer to the UI

## Security Architecture

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Blockchain verification for critical transactions
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

## Deployment Architecture

The EHB platform uses a modular deployment strategy where each component can be deployed independently while maintaining integration through standardized APIs and communication protocols.
