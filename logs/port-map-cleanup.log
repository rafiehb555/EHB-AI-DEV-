# EHB Port Mapping Cleanup Log
## Date: 2025-05-15

## Summary
- Created /configs/port-mapping.json documenting all current port bindings in the system
- Fixed port conflicts by removing port 5130 from port-internal-redirector.js
- Identified and documented other port conflicts in the port mapping file

## Port Conflicts Identified
1. Port 3000 conflict between:
   - centralRedirector (EHB-Central-Redirector)
   - replitUrlRedirector (Replit-URL-Redirector)
   
2. Port 5130 conflict between:
   - ehbFreeAgentApi (EHB Free Agent API)
   - portInternalRedirector (Port Internal Redirector)
   
3. Port 5200 sharing (intentional) between:
   - agentDashboard (Agent Dashboard)
   - autonomousAgentSystem (Autonomous Agent System)

## Actions Taken
1. Modified port-internal-redirector.js to remove port 5130 binding
   - Removed entry: `{ internalPort: 5130, externalPort: 5130, name: 'EHB Free Agent API' }`
   - Added comment explaining removal
   
2. Added port documentation in /configs/port-mapping.json
   - Organized by service type
   - Listed potential conflicts
   - Added workflow names and file paths for reference

## AI Agent Core Redundancy Implementation
- Primary port: 5123
- Backup ports: 5121, 5122, 5124
- AI Agent Core Redirector properly configured to check and use these ports
- Modified Whisper Command to connect to correct AI Agent Core port (5123)

## Next Steps
1. Restart Port Internal Redirector workflow to apply changes
2. Consider moving Replit-URL-Redirector to a different port (e.g., 3001 or 3005)
3. Ensure EHB Free Agent is configured to register with the AI Agent Core on port 5123
4. Update EHB Free Agent Config to use AI Agent Core on port 5123 instead of 5121
